The first line of input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$.

The second line of input contains $N$ integers, describing the array $A$.

## Subtasks and Constraints

For all subtasks, you are guaranteed that:

* $-10\,000 \leq a_i \leq 10\,000$.

Additionally:
* For Subtask 1 (7 points): $a_i \geq 0$
* For Subtask 2 (18 points): $K = N$
* For Subtask 3 (29 points): $N > 5$ and $K = N - 5$
* For Subtask 4 (13 points): $N \leq 3\,000$
* For Subtask 5 (28 points): no further constraints apply.
